## 💬 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### **1. Project Overview Questions**

**Q: Tell me about your project**
> "I built a Distributed Transaction Engine that processes 10,000+ concurrent transactions with 99.9% uptime. It uses microservices architecture with Spring Boot, implements distributed locking with Redis, and circuit breakers for fault tolerance."

**Q: Why did you choose this project?**
> "Payment systems are critical for companies like JusPay. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to build scalable, reliable systems that handle financial transactions with data integrity and high performance."

**Q: What makes it distributed?**
> "The system uses:
> - Multiple microservices that can scale independently
> - Redis for distributed locking across instances
> - Message queues for asynchronous processing
> - Stateless design allowing horizontal scaling"

### **2. Technical Architecture Questions**

**Q: Explain the architecture**
> "It's a microservices architecture with:
> - API Gateway for routing and load balancing
> - Transaction Service as the core processor
> - Redis for distributed locking and caching
> - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
> - RabbitMQ for event-driven communication
> - Circuit breakers for resilience"

**Q: How do you handle distributed transactions?**
> "I use:
> - Distributed locking with Redis to prevent race conditions
> - Two-phase commit for critical operations
> - Saga pattern for long-running transactions
> - Optimistic locking at the database level"

**Q: What is distributed locking and why use it?**
> "Distributed locking ensures only one instance processes a transaction at a time. I use Redis with Redisson client, which provides:
> - Lock acquisition with timeout
> - Automatic lock release
> - Prevents duplicate processing
> - Maintains data consistency"

### **3. Performance & Scalability Questions**

**Q: How do you achieve 10,000 TPS?**
> "Through:
> - Horizontal scaling with multiple instances
> - Connection pooling (HikariCP with 100 connections)
> - Async processing with CompletableFuture
> - Database query optimization with proper indexing
> - Redis caching for frequently accessed data"

**Q: What's your latency performance?**
> "The system achieves:
> - P50: 10ms (median)
> - P95: 15ms
> - P99: 37ms
> All well under the 200ms target for payment systems"

**Q: How do you scale the system?**
> "Scaling strategies:
> - Horizontal: Add more service instances
> - Database: Read replicas and sharding
> - Caching: Redis cluster for distributed cache
> - Async: Message queues for decoupling
> - Load balancing: API Gateway distributes traffic"

### **4. Reliability & Fault Tolerance Questions**

**Q: How do you ensure 99.9% uptime?**
> "Multiple strategies:
> - Circuit breakers with Resilience4j
> - Retry logic with exponential backoff
> - Fallback mechanisms for failures
> - Health checks and auto-recovery
> - Graceful degradation of services"

**Q: Explain circuit breaker pattern**
> "Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures:
> - CLOSED: Normal operation
> - OPEN: Too many failures, reject requests
> - HALF-OPEN: Test if service recovered
>
> Configuration:
> - Failure threshold: 40%
> - Wait duration: 20 seconds
> - Sliding window: 200 requests"

**Q: How do you handle failures?**
> "Multi-level approach:
> - Circuit breakers stop cascading failures
> - Retry with exponential backoff
> - Dead letter queues for failed messages
> - Fallback to cache or default responses
> - Monitoring and alerting for quick response"

### **5. Database & Data Management Questions**

**Q: Why PostgreSQL?**
> "PostgreSQL provides:
> - ACID compliance for financial data
> - Complex query support
> - JSON support for flexible schemas
> - Excellent performance with indexing
> - Mature and reliable"

**Q: How do you optimize database queries?**
> "Optimization techniques:
> - Proper indexing on transaction_id, status, created_at
> - Connection pooling with HikariCP
> - Batch operations for bulk inserts
> - Query optimization with SKIP LOCKED
> - Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection"

**Q: How do you handle database transactions?**
> "Using:
> - @Transactional annotation for Spring transactions
> - Optimistic locking with @Version
> - Proper isolation levels
> - Rollback on exceptions
> - Two-phase commit for distributed transactions"

### **6. Security Questions**

**Q: How do you secure the system?**
> "Security measures:
> - API authentication (JWT tokens planned)
> - HTTPS for all communications
> - Input validation and sanitization
> - SQL injection prevention with prepared statements
> - Rate limiting at API Gateway
> - Encryption for sensitive data"

**Q: How do you handle PCI compliance?**
> "For payment systems:
> - Never store full card numbers
> - Tokenization for sensitive data
> - Audit logging for all transactions
> - Encryption at rest and in transit
> - Regular security audits"

### **7. Testing & Deployment Questions**

**Q: How do you test the system?**
> "Multiple levels:
> - Unit tests with JUnit 5
> - Integration tests with TestContainers
> - Load testing with JMeter (verified 10,000 TPS)
> - Local testing with H2 database
> - Demo application for functionality testing"

**Q: How do you deploy this?**
> "Deployment options:
> - Docker containers for packaging
> - Docker Compose for local deployment
> - Kubernetes for production (configs ready)
> - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
> - Rolling updates for zero downtime"

**Q: How do you monitor the system?**
> "Comprehensive monitoring:
> - Prometheus for metrics collection
> - Grafana for visualization
> - Spring Actuator health endpoints
> - ELK stack for centralized logging
> - Custom metrics for business KPIs"

### **8. Frontend/Demo Questions**

**Q: Tell me about the landing page**
> "I built an interactive React landing page that:
> - Demonstrates real-time transaction processing
> - Shows live performance metrics
> - Supports CSV file uploads for testing
> - Has animated architecture diagrams
> - Provides a complete view of system capabilities"

**Q: Can we test with real data?**
> "Yes! The system supports:
> - CSV file upload for bulk transactions
> - Sample data download for testing
> - Real-time processing visualization
> - Live metrics during processing"

### **9. Specific Code Questions**

**Q: Show me the distributed locking code**
```java
public <T> T executeWithLock(String lockKey, Supplier<T> action) {
    RLock lock = redissonClient.getLock(lockKey);
    try {
        if (lock.tryLock(10, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            return action.get();
        }
        throw new LockException("Could not acquire lock");
    } finally {
        if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

**Q: Show me the circuit breaker implementation**
```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "transaction-processing",
                fallbackMethod = "processTransactionFallback")
@Retry(name = "transaction-processing")
public Transaction processTransaction(Transaction txn) {
    // Processing logic
}

public Transaction processTransactionFallback(
    Transaction txn, Exception ex) {
    // Fallback logic
    return txn.withStatus(PENDING);
}
```

### **10. Problem-Solving Questions**

**Q: How would you handle duplicate transactions?**
> "Multiple strategies:
> - Idempotency keys for each transaction
> - Distributed locking on transaction ID
> - Database unique constraints
> - Check existence before processing
> - Return same response for duplicates"

**Q: How do you handle peak loads?**
> "Load management:
> - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
> - Queue-based load leveling
> - Rate limiting per client
> - Caching for read-heavy operations
> - Database connection pooling"

**Q: What if Redis goes down?**
> "Fallback strategies:
> - Local locking as fallback (single instance)
> - Database-level locking
> - Graceful degradation
> - Circuit breaker prevents cascading failure
