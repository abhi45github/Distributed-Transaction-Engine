## 💡 INTERVIEW SCENARIOS

### **If interviewer says: "Can you test with our data?"**

**Your Response:**
> "Absolutely! The system supports CSV file uploads. You can either:
> 1. Download the sample CSV template
> 2. Use your own CSV file with transaction data
> 3. Upload it directly through the interface
>
> Let me show you..."

**Actions:**
1. Click **"Sample CSV"** to show the format
2. Click **"Upload CSV"**
3. Select their file
4. Show real-time processing

### **If interviewer says: "Show me the architecture"**

**Your Response:**
> "I've created an animated architecture diagram that shows the complete transaction flow..."

**Actions:**
1. Click **"View Architecture"** button
2. Point out the animated flow
3. Explain each layer as it highlights
4. Show the distributed locking and circuit breaker components

### **If interviewer says: "How does it handle load?"**

**Your Response:**
> "Let me demonstrate with both simulated and real data..."

**Actions:**
1. Run the automated demo (shows 1000 TPS)
2. Upload a large CSV file
3. Point to the metrics showing:
   - Success rate staying above 99%
   - P99 latency under 200ms
   - TPS scaling up to 1000+
